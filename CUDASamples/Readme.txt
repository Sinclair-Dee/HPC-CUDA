The file CodeSamples.zip provides the code files for samples used in the chapters as
illustrative examples.

Each chapter has its own code folder that includes the sample .c and .cu files
for that chapter. The per-chapter folders each also include a Makefile that can
be used to build the samples included.

The common/ directory contains common.h, which includes code that is common to
multiple chapters.

The file Solutions.zip provides solution text and code for each chapter's exercises.

The text solutions for every chapter are included in ExerciseSolutions.pdf.

Each chapter also has its own code folder. This folder includes sample .c and .cu
code solutions for any exercises that require them. Each per-chapter code
folder also includes a Makefile that can be used to build the solutions
included.
